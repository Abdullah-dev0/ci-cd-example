# CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline setup. The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development workflow.

## Features

- **Automated Testing**: Run unit tests and integration tests automatically on each commit to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Build Automation**: Automatically build the application and create artifacts ready for deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy the application to a staging or production environment seamlessly after passing all tests and build processes.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Implement linting and static code analysis to maintain code standards.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications on build and deployment statuses through preferred communication channels.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Code Commit**: Developers commit code changes to the repository.
2. **Automated Testing**: The CI server triggers automated tests, including unit and integration tests.
3. **Build Process**: After successful testing, the application is built and artifacts are generated.
4. **Deployment**: The build artifacts are deployed to the specified environment (staging/production).
5. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Perform smoke tests and additional checks in the deployed environment to ensure stability.
6. **Notifications**: Notify the team about the status of the deployment.
